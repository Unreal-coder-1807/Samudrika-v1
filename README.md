# Underwater Maritime Security AI Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a **computer vision pipeline for underwater maritime security monitoring**. The system enhances underwater imagery, detects potential security-related objects, evaluates threat levels, and explains model decisions using explainable AI techniques.

The pipeline is designed as a **research prototype** to simulate AI-assisted underwater surveillance.

The system processes **images or extracted video frames**, improving visibility before performing object detection and threat analysis.

# Core Modules

## 1. Data Ingestion

The pipeline accepts:

* Underwater image datasets
* Frames extracted from underwater videos
* Synthetic underwater scenes

Video support is implemented through **frame extraction** rather than direct video model training.

---

# 2. Image Enhancement

Underwater images typically suffer from:

* low visibility
* color distortion
* light scattering
* turbidity

The enhancement module improves image quality before object detection.

Model Used:

FUnIE-GAN

Framework:

PyTorch

Workflow:

```
Raw Image → Enhancement Model → Enhanced Image
```

---

# 3. Object Detection

Object detection identifies potential maritime security threats.

Model Used:

YOLOv8

Detected object categories may include:

* submarines
* underwater drones
* ROVs
* naval mines
* torpedo-like structures
* divers
* underwater equipment

Outputs:

* bounding boxes
* object class
* confidence score

---

# 4. Feature Embedding

Detected objects are cropped and converted into **feature embeddings**.

Purpose:

* enable similarity comparison
* allow object identity matching
* reduce repeated processing

Feature extractor:

ResNet50

Workflow:

```
Detected Object Crop → Embedding Model → Feature Vector
```

---

# 5. Vector Similarity Search

Object embeddings are stored in a **vector index**.

Vector search enables:

* similarity matching
* identity comparison
* faster retrieval

Vector database used:

FAISS

---

# 6. Threat Evaluation Engine

Detections are converted into **risk assessments**.

Example threat logic:

```
Submarine → HIGH threat
Naval mine → CRITICAL threat
Diver → MEDIUM threat
ROV → LOW threat
```

Threat scoring considers:

* object type
* detection confidence
* similarity matches

---

# 7. Explainability Layer

Explainable AI improves operator trust by showing **why the model made a decision**.

Technique:

Grad-CAM

Output:

Heatmaps highlighting regions responsible for the detection.

Example:

```
Detected Object: Submarine
Explanation: Heatmap highlighting hull region
```

---

# 8. Operator Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard displays results to operators.

Features:

* processed image display
* detected object bounding boxes
* threat level indicator
* explanation heatmaps
* system alerts

Backend:

FastAPI

Frontend:

React

Visualization:

Plotly
